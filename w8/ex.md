# Exercises 
$2\cdot\frac{1}{3} + 5\cdot\frac{1}{2} + 8\cdot\frac{1}{6} $

$E[X] = \frac{2}{9} = 4.5$

$ \sum 2^b \cdot \frac{1}{2^{b+1}} = 2^{i+1} $

Partial sums to $\frac{n+1}{2}$

# 3.1
$1/n$

# 3.2

$ \frac{1}{2^{\sum_{j=0}^{i} X_j}}   $


# 5.1
O(1) when B_1 has a bottle of beer

# 5.2
O(N-k) when tail: B_n, B_n-1 has bottles of beer.

# 5.3
1:

$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \cdot \frac{k}{n} = \frac{1}{2}k(n-1)$

2:
O($\infty$)
Truly randomness, could pick the same i which could not have a bottle of beer, and would never pick anything else.
