\section{Correctness}
The algorithm ensures correctness by always taking the max of solutions to all sub problems, thus preserving optimal substructures.
With a correct solution to trivial base cases and the ensurance of optimal substructures, a correct complete solution to the original problem can be ensured.

To alleviate potential incorectness from missing details in Ronald's strategy, the algorithm also handles cases where Ronald could pick either leftmost and rightmost because of equality.
